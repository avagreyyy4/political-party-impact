    "text": "1 Introduction\nPolitical polarization in the United States as greatly intensified throughout the twenty-first century. In fact, partisan hatred, which is intense dislike for the opposite party, has increased considerably from the late 20th century to the mid 2010’s, with negative sentiment targeted towards to opposite party’s idealogies nearly doubling during that time within both major parties1.\nIn the United States, the two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, dominate every presidential election cycle. In the 21st century (excluding the 2024 Presidential Election), there have been six elections, resulting in four different administrations: two Democratic and two Republican. Additionally, each party has “safe states,” which predominantly vote for that party regardless of the election or candidate. This project will explore economic statistics for safe states at the state-by-state level from 2001 to 2024 (covering the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations). The goal of this project is to explore whether a state that consistently votes for the same party in every presidential election experiences stronger economic outcomes during that party’s administrations than during the other party’s administrations. Generally, this project aims to understand if political polarization is warranted, that is, are states truly better off always voting for the same party or are states more similar in economic turnout than political ideology.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for this project has been pulled from various government databases. The first dataset is from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis and contains information on each state’s GDP, various per-capita personal income variables, and employment from 2001 to 2024 (Economic Factors by State). The Bureau of Economic Analysis obtains most of its data from Census Bureau surveys or federal administration surveys. The United States Census obtains yearly data through randomized surveys of thousands of American households and, with those results and government records, estimates population-sized values1.\nThe second dataset, from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), contains median household income data for each state from 2001 to 2024 (Median Income by State). The dataset has 53 columns, including “Year”, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the United States average, and 23 rows spanning 2001 through 2024.\nThe last dataset from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training contains the unemployment rate for each state from 2000 to 2024 (Unemployment Rate by State). The dataset has 25 columns, including “State” and the years 2000 through 2024, and 52 rows, including all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the United States average.\nThis paragraph will describe some potential limitations and issues with the data. First, some of the data sources are not corrected for inflation. This means that monetary values between years are not completely comparable. To avoid misleading results, the analysis will create features to standardize for these differences. For example, creating variables in relation to the US average in order to identify differences in relative values, not raw values. Additionally, median income and various per-capita variables are estimates and do not accurately reflect populations. So, it is important to remember this fact when exploring findings.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThe only dataset with missing values is the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis which contains data across states and years on various economic factors. Since the unemployement rate and median income data sets do not contain and missing values, they will not be explored in this section for simplicity.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(redav)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nvarious_factors &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/avagrey/political-party-impact/data/clean_preprocessed/various_factors_clean.csv\")\n\nvarious_factors |&gt;\n  filter(State == \"Alabama\") |&gt;\n  plot_missing(percent = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the data set is large, the plot above is only looking at missing patterns for the state of Alabama. However, as the plot states, every safe state follows this pattern. Either the row has every variable, or, it is missing Real Personal Income, Real Personal Consumption Expenditures, Real Per Capita Personal Income, and Real Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures. From these patterns it is clear that certain years Personal Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures were not recorded at the raw level and the per capita level.\nSince the data can also be formatted by year rather than state, there could also be insight into specific years missing data.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nvarious_factors |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(State, Year),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )|&gt;\n  group_by(Year, variable) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    pct_missing = mean(is.na(value)) * 100,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )|&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = variable, fill = pct_missing)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\",\n    high = \"purple\",\n    name = \"% Missing\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Missing Data Percentage Across States by Year and Variable\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001, 2012, 2024))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot aims to identify which years are missing the four variables and how often they are (in relation to the states). However, it is clear from this plot that for every state the same eight years are missing the same four variables. It seems that data for the missing variables were not recorded at the beginning of the 21st century. Also, potentially at the time the data was pulled, 2024 had not been recorded.\nSince every state is missing data for Real Personal Income, Real Per Capita Personal Income, Real Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures, and Real Personal Consumption Expenditures through the years 2001-2007 and 2024, the analysis will focus on the available data an adjust for inflation impact with feature engineering relative metrics.",

    "text": "3.1 Unemployement Rate\nThis section summarizes key findings from each dataset, identifying trends across economic factors and safe states.\nThe first variable of interest is Unemployment Rate. To understand presidential impact, the variable change was created. Change is defined as the unemployment rate of the state the last year the respective president was in office subtracted from the first year they took office. Naturally, certain states have lower unemployment rates for reasons related to population size, specific industries, or age of workforce. To account for these difference, the analysis uses a metric that aims to quantitative the state’s change in relation to the overall United State’s change. So, each state has a value “Difference from US,” which is the change in the individuals state’s unemployment rate for the respective administration subtracted by the United State’s change in unemployment rate for the same administration.\nFirst, these values were plotted with a Cleveland Dot plot to see if there are overall trends with unemployment rate. Recall, a lower unemployment rate is better, so a lower difference from US is better as well.\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/avagrey/political-party-impact/data/clean_preprocessed/unemployement_clean.csv\")\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(administration = factor(\n    administration,\n    levels = c(\"Bush\", \"Obama\", \"Trump\", \"Biden\")  \n  )) |&gt; mutate(State_in_panel = reorder_within(State, dif_from_us, administration))\n\nunemployement_us_avg |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = dif_from_us, y = State_in_panel, color = Vote)) + geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~administration, scales = \"free_y\") + scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Republican\" = \"red\",\n      \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\",\n      \"United States\" = \"gray\"\n    )) + scale_y_reordered() + labs(y = \"State\", x = \"Average Unemployement Rate\",\n                                    title = \"Difference from US Change in Unemployement Rate Throughout 21st Century Across Administrations\")\nUnder Obama, Trump, and Biden there are clear differences with safe red and safe blue state outcomes under the opposite party. Under Democratic presidents (Obama and Biden), Republican states experience smaller or no improvement in unemployment rate compared to the US average. In fact, it seems that most of the top half of the states that perform worse than the US average are Republican states. Similarly, under Trump, the state’s that perform the worst compared to the US average are all Democratic states. Additionally, under Obama, Trump, and Biden, safe state’s seem to see a larger decrease in unemployment rate compared to the US average under their respective administration. While Bush does not have an as strong pattern, the majority of states that see a greater reduction in unemployment rate compared to the US average are Republican states.\nIt is also helpful to understand this patterns more generally rather than at a state and administration level.\nCode\nrate_colors &lt;- c(\"#008837\", \"#7b3294\")\n\nmosaic2 &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(Change = ifelse(dif_from_us &lt;= 0, \"Decrease\", \"Increase\"))|&gt;\n  mutate(Administration = case_when(\n    administration == \"Biden\" ~ \"Democrat\",\n    administration == \"Obama\" ~ \"Democrat\",\n    administration == \"Trump\" ~ \"Republican\",\n    administration == \"Bush\" ~ \"Republican\"\n  ))|&gt;\n  select(Vote, Change, Administration) |&gt; \n  group_by(Vote, Change, Administration) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n()) |&gt; ungroup() \n\nvcd::mosaic(Change ~ Vote + Administration, mosaic2, direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n            highlighting_fill = rate_colors)\nThis mosaic plot looks at the frequency of states that perform better or worse compared to the US average. Interestingly, while the Cleveland Dot plot showed that the political party the safe state voted for impacted their unemployment rate change, the mosaic plot communicates a slightly different pattern. The plot above shows that Republican states greater experience impact on their unemployment rate depending on the administration’s party while Democratic states’ do not. Under Republican presidents, Republican state’s unemployment rate mostly go down compared to the US average while under Democratic presidents it tends to go up. Comparatively, Democratic States experience little-to-no difference in their unemployment rate compared to the US average regardless of the administration’s party.\nIt may be helpful to geographically plot unemployment rate change from US average to see if there are geographical patterns.\nCode\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(usmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    state = State  \n  )\n\nlim &lt;- max(abs(unemployement_us_avg$dif_from_us), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nfour_maps &lt;- plot_usmap(\n  regions = \"states\",\n  data = unemployement_us_avg,\n  values = \"dif_from_us\"\n) +\n  facet_wrap(~ administration, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    name     = \"State − US change\",\n    low      = \"#008837\",\n    high     = \"#7b3294\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits   = c(-lim, lim),\n    oob      = scales::squish,\n    na.value = \"grey90\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nfour_maps$data &lt;- four_maps$data |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(administration))\n\nfour_maps &lt;- four_maps +\n  coord_sf(datum = NA) +  \n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nfour_maps\nIt is clear that the middle of the country has strong changes across administrations. Specifically, states like Wyoming, Nebraska, Utah, South and North Dakota, and Kansas have strong differences. Under Republican administrations these state’s perform better and under Democratic administrations they perform worse. While this makes sense because they are Republican safe states, it is also interesting that the degree they perform differently. The darkest part of the country for each administration (regardless of direction), is the middle of the country.\nThis pattern is clearly seen with a head map by standard deviation of Unemployment rate change compared to the United States Average.\nCode\nstate_order &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  group_by(State) %&gt;%\n  summarise(var_gap = sd(dif_from_us, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(var_gap) |&gt;\n  pull(State)\n\nlim &lt;- max(abs(unemployement_us_avg$dif_from_us), na.rm = TRUE)\n\ndifference_visual &lt;- ggplot(\n  unemployement_us_avg,\n  aes(x = administration,\n      y = factor(State, levels = state_order),  \n      fill = dif_from_us)\n) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"State − U.S. unemployment gap by administration\",\n       x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    name = \"State − US change\",\n    low = \"#008837\", mid = \"white\", high = \"#7b3294\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits = c(-lim, lim),\n    labels = label_percent(accuracy = 0.001),   \n    na.value = \"grey90\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\n\ndifference_visual\nThis heat map reinforces the same idea as the geographical plots, many states in the middle of the country, like Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Utah, see the largest unemployment differences across administration. Besides an outlier like Hawaii, the majority of the top states are Republican (affirms the mosaic plot) and located in the middle of the country. Comparatively, many East Coast and coastal states, like Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and New Jersey, experience very little change in their unemployment rate regardless of the political party in office.",

Also, these values are adjusted for inflation in current dollars, so while Alaska is an outlier with their median income, the true value at the time was smaller.\nBoth Democratic and Republican states seemed to experience the same relative median income increase from 2001 to 2024, both of their median values increased by a similar amount. Also, it seems that both Republican and Democratic states have higher variability in 2024 compared to 2001. Both box plots in 2024 are longer and have longer whiskers, communicating that the data is more spread out. Specifically, both Democratic and Republican state’s seem to skew more right in 2024 indicating a potential widening in wealth inequality among both sets of states.\nPlotting median income by year averaged for each set of states can be helpful to see more granular trends at a year-by-year basis.\n\n\nCode\nmedian_income &lt;- median_income |&gt; \n  group_by(Year, vote) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg = mean(median_income), .groups = \"drop\") \n  \nmedian_income|&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = avg, color = vote)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Republican\" = \"red\",\n      \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\")) + \n      annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2009-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2016-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2001-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2008-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n    annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2017-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2020-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2025-01-01\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Median Income\",\n    title = \"Average Median Income by State Party\")+\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot again shows that Democratic State’s earn more than Republican states. However, this plot is interesting since it shows the patterns in median income change for both sets of states are the same. Republican and Democratic states’ median incomes change identically regardless of the administration’s political party. For example, they both had strong increases during the latter part of Obama’s term (2012-2016) and that growth continued with Trump prior to Covid (2017-2019). So, overall, there are not any indicators that show median income performance depends on the presidential party.\nHowever, since the two sets of states have median income values that are fairly different, it could be more insightful to plot relative growth. For example, indexing the average median income to better see how the two sets of state’s perform relative to the start of the 21st century to try to identify smaller slope differences.\n\n\nCode\nmedian_income &lt;- median_income |&gt;\n  group_by(vote) |&gt; \n  arrange(Year) |&gt; \n  mutate(start_value = first(avg),\n         index = (avg / start_value) * 1) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nslope_plot2 &lt;- median_income |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = index, color = vote)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2009-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2016-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2001-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2008-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n    annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2017-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2020-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2025-01-01\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\",\n    \"Republican\" = \"red\"\n  )) +\n\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Indexed Median Income\",\n    title = \"Relative Growth in Median Income by State Party Group\"\n  )\n\nslope_plot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the average median income is indexed, smaller slope differences are easier to see. For example, during Bush and Trump (both red backgrounds), Democratic states had instances of higher relative median income, while Republican States never outperformed Democratic States. Additionally, both sets of states performed very similar under Obama, but near the end, and transitioning under Trump, Democratic State’s began to perform a lot better. This pattern carried into Biden’s term with Democratic State staying above Republican States.",

Alternatively, some Democratic states have longer negative tails under Republican administrations. For Personal Income and Disposable Personal Income there are left tails that go farther out than any Republican states. However, for the most part, Republican state distributions are farther negative (peforming worse compared to the US), compared to Democratic states.\n\n\nCode\ndata_ready &lt;- various_factors |&gt;\n  group_by(administration) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    outlier_label = ifelse(\n      (PC_PCE_dif &gt; 3800 | PC_DPI_dif &gt; 5800),\n      State,\n      NA\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\ndata_ready$administration &lt;- factor(\n  data_ready$administration,\n  levels = c(\"Bush\", \"Obama\", \"Trump\", \"Biden\")\n)\n\nggplot(data_ready, aes(\n    x = PC_DPI_dif, \n    y = PC_PCE_dif, \n    color = vote\n)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +\n\n  # ---- NEW PART: LABEL OUTLIERS ----\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = outlier_label),\n    size = 3,\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    box.padding = 0.4,\n    point.padding = 0.2,\n    min.segment.length = 0\n  ) +\n\n  facet_wrap(~ administration) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Republican\" = \"#D62728\", \"Democrat\" = \"#1F77B4\")\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Per Capita Disposable Personal Income Difference (vs US)\",\n    y = \"Per Capita Consumption Expenditures Difference (vs US)\",\n    title = \"State Differences in PCE vs DPI by Administration\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots aim to understand State’s Disposable Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures, which can give insight into State household economic resources. For all four administrations, there are clear clustering between Democrat and Republican States. Overall, Democratic states tend to have higher Disposable Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures. However, under Trump and Bush the difference is smaller. Specifically, under Bush more Republican states have larger Disposable Income, and under Trump the state’s are a lot closer together.\nAdditionally, it is interesting how the District of Columbia and Wyoming are consistent outlines for Personal Consumption Expenditures and Disposable Income, respectively, across multiple administrations.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# ------------------------------------\n# 1.

Under Republican administrations there are clearer clusters specifically for Republican States. States like Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming are very high on DPI and PI, while there is a cluster of red states lower. Additionally, very few Republican states are high on variables under Democratic administrations. Under Democratic administrations, Democratic states perform well, specifically for PCE.\nLooking at clusters, larger, more populated states, like California, New York, Massachusetts, are bigger outliers under Democratic administrations. Comparatively, under Republican administrates they tend to be closer with other states.\nAlso, the cluster of Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, related back to the findings on middle of the country states. They are higher on income related factors like PI and DPI under republican administrations which could indicate again those state’s benefit under Republican administration because of their geographical location.",
