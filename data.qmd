# Data

## Description

The data for this project has been pulled from various government databases. The first dataset is from the United States census and contains median salary values broken down by ethnicity and gender from the years 2000 to 2024 [Text to show](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html). The United States Census obtains yearly data through randomized surveys of thousands of American households and, with those results and government records, estimates population-sized values. 


The second dataset is from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis and contains information on each state's GDP, per capita personal income, and employment from 2001 to 2024 (https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-by-state). The Bureau of Economic Analysis obtains most of its data from Census Bureau surveys or federal administration surveys.  


The third dataset, from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), contains median household income data for each state from 2001 to 2024 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=259515&rid=249). The dataset has two variables, "State" and "Median Income," with 23 entries spanning 2001 through 2024. The FRED obtains its aggregated data from the United States Census data. 


The last dataset from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training contains the unemployment rate for each state from 2000 to 2024 (https://dlt.ri.gov/labor-market-information). The dataset has two columns, "State" and "Unemployment Rate", and 24 entries spanning the years 2000 and 2024. Again, this data was obtained from the United States census. 


This project also plans to reference, but not directly use, election result data. This data will consist of the percentage of the state that voted for each major party, and the percentage of each sex and ethnicity that voted for each major party, for each election from 2000 to 2024. 

This paragraph will describe some potential limitations and issues with the data. First, some of the data sources are not corrected for inflation. This means that monetary values between years are not completely comparable. To avoid misleading results, the analysis may explore differences between years for every state or manually adjust certain features for inflation. Secondly, for ethnic demographic data, many ambiguous assumptions exist for users filling out surveys. This means there may be inconsistencies with how survey-takers interpret or answer the questions. Data related to the sex or ethnicity of United States citizens may not be included in the final analysis due to comparison limitations (demographic breakdowns may not be available for early elections) and potential biases in the survey data.
