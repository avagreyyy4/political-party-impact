    "text": "1 Introduction\nPolitical polarization in the United States has intensified throughout the twenty-first century, with many states and demographics aligning with the same political parties every presidential election. In the United States, there are two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, which dominate every presidential election cycle. While historically political parties have shown consistent geographic and demographic patterns, do these administrations truly improve the economic outcomes of the groups that vote for them? That is, do presidential administrations lead to better economic outcomes for constituencies that vote for them, or are outcomes broadly similar regardless of which party wins? For example, this project aims to answer a question like “Does a state that consistently votes for the Republican party every presidential election, experience stronger economic outcomes during Republican administrations compared to Democratic administrations?” This project will explore economic statistics at the state-by-state and demographic levels from 2001 to 2024 (covering the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations) to identify trends and differences across specific groups over time.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for this project has been pulled from various government databases. The first dataset is from the United States census and contains median salary values broken down by ethnicity and gender from the years 2000 to 2024 (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html). The United States Census obtains yearly data through randomized surveys of thousands of American households and, with those results and government records, estimates population-sized values.\nThe second dataset is from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis and contains information on each state’s GDP, per capita personal income, and employment from 2001 to 2024 (https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-by-state). The Bureau of Economic Analysis obtains most of its data from Census Bureau surveys or federal administration surveys.\nThe third dataset, from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), contains median household income data for each state from 2001 to 2024 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=259515&rid=249). The dataset has two variables, “State” and “Median Income,” with 23 entries spanning 2001 through 2024. The FRED obtains its aggregated data from the United States Census data.\nThe last dataset from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training contains the unemployment rate for each state from 2000 to 2024 (https://dlt.ri.gov/labor-market-information). The dataset has two columns, “State” and “Unemployment Rate”, and 24 entries spanning the years 2000 and 2024. Again, this data was obtained from the United States census.\nThis project also plans to reference, but not directly use, election result data. This data will consist of the percentage of the state that voted for each major party, and the percentage of each sex and ethnicity that voted for each major party, for each election from 2000 to 2024.\nThis paragraph will describe some potential limitations and issues with the data. First, some of the data sources are not corrected for inflation. This means that monetary values between years are not completely comparable. To avoid misleading results, the analysis may explore differences between years for every state or manually adjust certain features for inflation. Secondly, for ethnic demographic data, many ambiguous assumptions exist for users filling out surveys. This means there may be inconsistencies with how survey-takers interpret or answer the questions. Data related to the sex or ethnicity of United States citizens may not be included in the final analysis due to comparison limitations (demographic breakdowns may not be available for early elections) and potential biases in the survey data.",
