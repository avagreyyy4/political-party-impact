    "text": "1 Introduction\nPolitical polarization in the United States has greatly intensified throughout the twenty-first century. In fact, partisan hatred, which is intense dislike for the opposite party, has increased substantially from the late 20th century to the mid 2010’s, with negative sentiment toward the opposite party’s ideologies, nearly doubling during that time within both major parties1.\nIn the United States, the two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, dominate every presidential election cycle. In the 21st century (excluding the 2024 presidential election), there have been six elections, resulting in four different administrations: two Democratic and two Republican. Each party also has “safe states,” which have voted for the same party over the last six elections, often by large margins.\nThis project will explore economic statistics for safe states at the state-by-state level from 2001 to 2024 (covering the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations). The goal of this project is to explore whether a state that consistently votes for the same party in every presidential election experiences stronger economic outcomes during that party’s administrations compared to during the other party’s administrations. On a larger scale, this project aims to understand if political polarization is warranted, specifically, whether consistently voting for the same party aligns with measurable economic outcomes, or if states are in fact more similar economically than their political identities suggest.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for this project has been pulled from various government databases. The first data set is from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, which contains the unemployment rate for each state from 2000 to 2024 (Unemployment Rate by State). The dataset has 25 columns, including “State” and the years 2000 through 2024, and 52 rows, including all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the United States average. These values were obtained from the United States Census. The United States Census acquires yearly state-by-state economic data through randomized surveys of thousands of American households and, with those results and government records, estimates population-sized values1.\nThe second dataset, from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), contains median household income data for each state from 2001 to 2024 (Median Income by State). The dataset has 53 columns, including “Year”, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the United States average, along with 23 rows spanning 2001 through 2024. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis aggregated these yearly values from the United States Census.\nThe last dataset is from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis and contains information on each state’s GDP, various per-capita personal income variables, and employment from 2001 to 2024 (Economic Factors by State). The Bureau of Economic Analysis obtains most of its data from Census Bureau surveys or federal administration surveys. The variables of focus from this dataset are Per Capita Personal Income, Per Capita Disposable Personal Income, and Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures. Personal Income is the total money received, which can include salary, investments, or government payments, before taxes, in relation to a state’s population. Disposable Personal Income measures the amount of money individuals have available from their personal income after paying taxes and other mandatory fees in relation to their state’s population. Personal Consumption Expenditures measures an individual’s spending on goods and services in relation to their state’s population.\nAdditional variables from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis were not included in the exploratory data analysis due to limitations in handling missing values and in quantitative comparisons. For example, while GDP measures a state’s economic output, smaller states will inherently have lower GDP, making comparisons free of confounding variables difficult.\nThis paragraph will describe some potential limitations and issues with the data. First, some of the data sources are not corrected for inflation. This means that monetary values between years are not completely comparable. To avoid misleading results, the analysis will create features to standardize for these differences. For example, creating variables in relation to the US average in order to identify differences in relative values, not raw values. Additionally, both median income and per-capita variables are derived from survey-based estimates and may therefore not perfectly reflect the true behavior of each population.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThe only dataset with missing values is the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis which contains data across states and years on various economic factors. Since the unemployment rate and median income data sets do not contain and missing values, they will not be explored in this section for simplicity.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(redav)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nvarious_factors &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/avagrey/political-party-impact/data/clean_preprocessed/various_factors_clean_NA.csv\")\n\nvarious_factors |&gt;\n  filter(State == \"Alabama\") |&gt;\n  plot_missing(percent = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the data set is large, the plot above shows only the missing patterns for the state of Alabama. However, as the plot states, every safe state follows this pattern. Either the row includes all variables, or it is missing Real Personal Income, Real Personal Consumption Expenditures, Real Per Capita Personal Income, and Real Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures. From these patterns, it is clear that in certain years, Personal Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures were not recorded at the raw or per capita levels.\nSince the data can be formatted by year rather than state, this could yield insights into specific years with missing data.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nvarious_factors |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(State, Year),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )|&gt;\n  group_by(Year, variable) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    pct_missing = mean(is.na(value)) * 100,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )|&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = variable, fill = pct_missing)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\",\n    high = \"purple\",\n    name = \"% Missing\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Missing Data Percentage Across States by Year and Variable\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001, 2012, 2024))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot summarizes the percentage of missing values for each variable in each year, averaged across all states. It is clear from this plot that for every state, the same eight years are missing the same four variables. The only two percentages visualized are 100% and 0%. It seems that data for the missing variables were not recorded at the beginning of the 21st century. Also, potentially, the data was pulled before 2024 was recorded.",

    "text": "3.1 Unemployement Rate\nThis section summarizes key findings from each dataset, identifying trends across economic factors and safe states.\nThe first variable of interest is the Unemployment Rate. To quantify the impact of each presidency, a variable ‘change’ was created. Change is defined as the state’s unemployment rate in the last year the respective president was in office, subtracted from the first year they took office. Naturally, certain states have lower unemployment rates for reasons related to population size, specific industries, or the age of the workforce. To account for these differences, the analysis uses a metric that quantifies the state’s change relative to the overall change in the United States. So, each state has a value “Difference from US,” which is the change in the individual state’s unemployment rate for the respective administration, subtracted by the United States’ change in unemployment rate for the same administration.\nFirst, “Difference from US” was plotted with a Cleveland Dot plot to see if there are overall trends with unemployment rate by state and administration. Recall, a lower unemployment rate is better, so a lower difference from US is better as well.\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/avagrey/political-party-impact/data/clean_preprocessed/unemployement_clean.csv\")\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(administration = factor(\n    administration,\n    levels = c(\"Bush\", \"Obama\", \"Trump\", \"Biden\")  \n  )) |&gt; mutate(State_in_panel = reorder_within(State, dif_from_us, administration))\n\nunemployement_us_avg |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = dif_from_us, y = State_in_panel, color = Vote)) + geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~administration, scales = \"free_y\") + scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Republican\" = \"red\",\n      \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\",\n      \"United States\" = \"gray\"\n    )) + scale_y_reordered() + labs(y = \"State\", x = \"Average Unemployement Rate\",\n                                    title = \"Difference from US Change in Unemployement Rate Throughout 21st Century Across Administrations\")\nUnder Obama, Trump, and Biden, there are clear differences in safe red and safe blue state outcomes under the opposite party. Under Democratic presidents (Obama and Biden), Republican states experience smaller or no improvement in the unemployment rate compared to the US average. In fact, most of the top half of states that perform worse than the US average are Republican-voting. Similarly, under Trump, the states that perform worse compared to the US average are all Democratic-voting. Additionally, under Obama, Trump, and Biden, safe states seem to experience a larger decrease in the unemployment rate than the US average during their respective administrations, with many red dots at the bottom of Trump’s graph and many blue dots at the bottom of Obama’s and Biden’s. While Bush does not have as strong of a pattern, the majority of states that see a greater reduction in the unemployment rate than the US average are Republican states.\nIt is also helpful to understand this patterns more generally rather than at a state and administration level.\nCode\nrate_colors &lt;- c(\"#008837\", \"#7b3294\")\n\nmosaic2 &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(Change = ifelse(dif_from_us &lt;= 0, \"Decrease\", \"Increase\"))|&gt;\n  mutate(Administration = case_when(\n    administration == \"Biden\" ~ \"Democrat\",\n    administration == \"Obama\" ~ \"Democrat\",\n    administration == \"Trump\" ~ \"Republican\",\n    administration == \"Bush\" ~ \"Republican\"\n  ))|&gt;\n  select(Vote, Change, Administration) |&gt; \n  group_by(Vote, Change, Administration) |&gt;\n  summarize(Freq = n()) |&gt; ungroup() \n\nvcd::mosaic(Change ~ Vote + Administration, mosaic2, direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n            highlighting_fill = rate_colors)\nThis mosaic plot shows the frequency of states whose unemployment rate changes increase or decrease relative to the US, grouped by the administration’s party and the state’s voting preference. Interestingly, while the Cleveland Dot plot showed that the political party the safe state voted for affected its unemployment rate change, the mosaic plot shows a slightly different pattern.\nThe plot above shows that unemployment in Republican states fluctuates depending on the political party of the administration, while unemployment in Democratic states remains stable. Under Republican presidents, Republican states’ unemployment rates mostly go down compared to the US average, while under Democratic presidents, they tend to go up. This indicates a strong relationship between the administration’s party and the unemployment rate in Republican states. Compared with the US average, Democratic States experience little to no difference in their unemployment rates, regardless of the administration’s party.\nIt may be helpful to geographically plot unemployment rate change from US average to see if there are geographical patterns.\nCode\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(usmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nunemployement_us_avg &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    state = State  \n  )\n\nlim &lt;- max(abs(unemployement_us_avg$dif_from_us), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nfour_maps &lt;- plot_usmap(\n  regions = \"states\",\n  data = unemployement_us_avg,\n  values = \"dif_from_us\"\n) +\n  facet_wrap(~ administration, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    name     = \"State − US change\",\n    low      = \"#008837\",\n    high     = \"#7b3294\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits   = c(-lim, lim),\n    oob      = scales::squish,\n    na.value = \"grey90\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nfour_maps$data &lt;- four_maps$data |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(administration))\n\nfour_maps &lt;- four_maps +\n  coord_sf(datum = NA) +  \n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nfour_maps\nThe plot above communicates that states in the middle of the country have a greater change in unemployment rate difference across administrations. Specifically, states like Wyoming, Nebraska, Utah, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Kansas have clear positive and negative differences. Under Republican administrations, these states perform better, and under Democratic administrations, they perform worse. While this makes sense because they are Republican-safe states, it is also interesting that they seem to fluctuate more than other safe red states, turning dark green during Republican administrations and dark purple during Democratic administrations.\nA heat map showing the standard deviation of unemployment-rate changes relative to the U.S. average further supports this pattern.\nCode\nstate_order &lt;- unemployement_us_avg |&gt;\n  group_by(State) |&gt;\n  summarise(var_gap = sd(dif_from_us, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(var_gap) |&gt;\n  pull(State)\n\nlim &lt;- max(abs(unemployement_us_avg$dif_from_us), na.rm = TRUE)\n\ndifference_visual &lt;- ggplot(\n  unemployement_us_avg,\n  aes(x = administration,\n      y = factor(State, levels = state_order),  \n      fill = dif_from_us)\n) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"State − U.S. unemployment gap by administration\",\n       x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    name = \"State − US change\",\n    low = \"#008837\", mid = \"white\", high = \"#7b3294\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits = c(-lim, lim),\n    labels = label_percent(accuracy = 0.001),   \n    na.value = \"grey90\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\n\ndifference_visual\nThis heat map reinforces the same idea as the geographical plots; many states in the middle of the country, like Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Utah, show the largest unemployment differences across administrations. Besides an outlier like Hawaii, the majority of the top states are Republican (as shown in the mosaic plot) and are located in the middle of the country. Comparatively, many East Coast and coastal states, such as Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont, and New Jersey, have unemployment rates that change very little regardless of the political party in office.",

Also, these values are adjusted for inflation in current dollars, so while Alaska is an outlier with their median income, the true value at the time was smaller.\nBoth Democratic and Republican states seemed to experience the same relative median income increase from 2001 to 2024, both of their median values increased by a similar amount. Also, it seems that both Republican and Democratic states have higher variability in 2024 compared to 2001. Both box plots in 2024 are longer and have longer whiskers, communicating that the data is more spread out. Specifically, both Democratic and Republican state’s seem to skew more right in 2024 indicating a potential widening in wealth inequality among both sets of states.\nPlotting median income by year averaged for each set of states can be helpful to see more granular trends at a year-by-year basis.\n\n\nCode\nmedian_income &lt;- median_income |&gt; \n  group_by(Year, vote) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg = mean(median_income), .groups = \"drop\") \n  \nmedian_income|&gt;  \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = avg, color = vote)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Republican\" = \"red\",\n      \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\")) + \n      annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2009-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2016-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2001-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2008-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n    annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2017-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2020-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2025-01-01\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Median Income\",\n    title = \"Average Median Income by State Party\")+\n    theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot again shows that Democratic State’s earn more than Republican states. However, this plot is interesting since it shows the patterns in median income change for both sets of states are the same. Republican and Democratic states’ median incomes change identically regardless of the administration’s political party. For example, they both had strong increases during the latter part of Obama’s term (2012-2016) and that growth continued with Trump prior to Covid (2017-2019). So, overall, there are not any indicators that show median income performance depends on the presidential party.\nHowever, since the two sets of states have median income values that are fairly different, it could be more insightful to plot relative growth. For example, indexing the average median income to better see how the two sets of state’s perform relative to the start of the 21st century to try to identify smaller slope differences.\n\n\nCode\nmedian_income &lt;- median_income |&gt;\n  group_by(vote) |&gt; \n  arrange(Year) |&gt; \n  mutate(start_value = first(avg),\n         index = (avg / start_value) * 1) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nslope_plot2 &lt;- median_income |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = index, color = vote)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2009-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2016-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2001-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2008-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n    annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2017-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2020-12-31\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightcoral\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           xmin = as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"),\n           xmax = as.Date(\"2025-01-01\"),\n           ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,\n           fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2) +\n\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Democrat\"   = \"blue\",\n    \"Republican\" = \"red\"\n  )) +\n\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Indexed Median Income\",\n    title = \"Relative Growth in Median Income by State Party Group\"\n  ) +   theme_minimal()\n\nslope_plot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the average median income is indexed, smaller slope differences are easier to see. For example, during Bush and Trump (both red backgrounds), Democratic states had instances of higher relative median income, while Republican States never outperformed Democratic States. Additionally, both sets of states performed very similar under Obama, but near the end, and transitioning under Trump, Democratic State’s began to perform a lot better. This pattern carried into Biden’s term with Democratic State staying above Republican States.",

Also, since certain states may have higher values for various reasons not related to politics, the difference value for each state subtracted the US to obtain a more standardized measure for relative performance for these variables.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggridges)\nvarious_factors &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/avagrey/political-party-impact/data/clean_preprocessed/various_factors_clean.csv\")\n\ndf_ridge &lt;- various_factors |&gt;\n  group_by(presidental_party, State) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    vote = first(vote),\n    dif_PC_PI_US  = mean(PC_PI_dif, na.rm = TRUE),\n    dif_PC_DPI_US = mean(PC_DPI_dif, na.rm = TRUE),\n    dif_PC_PCE_US = mean(PC_PCE_dif, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;  \n  rename(\"Personal Income\" = 'dif_PC_PI_US',\n         \"Disposable Income\" = 'dif_PC_DPI_US',\n         \"Personal Consumption Expenditures\" = 'dif_PC_PCE_US') |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = `Personal Income`:`Personal Consumption Expenditures`,\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) \n\nggplot(df_ridge, \n       aes(x = value, \n           y = variable, \n           fill = vote)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.6, scale = 1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Democrat\" = \"blue\",\n                               \"Republican\" = \"red\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of State-Level Economic Differences\") +\n  xlab(\"Value\") +\n  ylab(\"Economic Variable\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ presidental_party)+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are not huge differences between Democrat and Republican administrations on the different state’s, it is clear that under Republican presidents, Republican state’s have larger positive tails. This indicates that there are more Republican state’s that perform better than the US than they would under Democratic presidents. For example, there is a strong positive tail for Personal Income and Disposable Personal Income for Republican States under Republican administrations. Alternatively, some Democratic states have longer negative tails under Republican administrations. For Personal Income and Disposable Personal Income there are left tails that go farther out than any Republican states. However, for the most part, Republican state distributions are farther negative (peforming worse compared to the US), compared to Democratic states.\n\n\nCode\ndata_ready &lt;- various_factors |&gt;\n  group_by(administration) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    outlier_label = ifelse(\n      (PC_PCE_dif &gt; 3800 | PC_DPI_dif &gt; 5800),\n      State,\n      NA\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\ndata_ready$administration &lt;- factor(\n  data_ready$administration,\n  levels = c(\"Bush\", \"Obama\", \"Trump\", \"Biden\")\n)\n\nggplot(data_ready, aes(\n    x = PC_DPI_dif, \n    y = PC_PCE_dif, \n    color = vote\n)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +\n\n  # ---- NEW PART: LABEL OUTLIERS ----\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = outlier_label),\n    size = 3,\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    box.padding = 0.4,\n    point.padding = 0.2,\n    min.segment.length = 0\n  ) +\n\n  facet_wrap(~ administration) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Republican\" = \"#D62728\", \"Democrat\" = \"#1F77B4\")\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Per Capita Disposable Personal Income Difference (vs US)\",\n    y = \"Per Capita Consumption Expenditures Difference (vs US)\",\n    title = \"State Differences in PCE vs DPI by Administration\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots aim to understand State’s Disposable Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures, which can give insight into State household economic resources. For all four administrations, there are clear clustering between Democrat and Republican States. Overall, Democratic states tend to have higher Disposable Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures. However, under Trump and Bush the difference is smaller. Specifically, under Bush more Republican states have larger Disposable Income, and under Trump the state’s are a lot closer together.\nAdditionally, it is interesting how the District of Columbia and Wyoming are consistent outlines for Personal Consumption Expenditures and Disposable Income, respectively, across multiple administrations.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nadmin_groups &lt;- various_factors |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    admin_party = case_when(\n      administration %in% c(\"Bush\", \"Trump\") ~ \"Republican Administration\",\n      administration %in% c(\"Obama\", \"Biden\") ~ \"Democratic Administration\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(State, vote, admin_party) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    PC_PCE_dif = mean(PC_PCE_dif, na.rm = TRUE),\n    PC_DPI_dif = mean(PC_DPI_dif, na.rm = TRUE),\n    PC_PI_dif  = mean(PC_PI_dif,  na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n\nadmin_groups_scaled &lt;- admin_groups |&gt;\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"PC_\"), ~ scale(.x)[,1]))\n\n\npca_all &lt;- prcomp(admin_groups_scaled[, 4:6], scale. = TRUE)\n\n\nscores &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_all$x)\nscores$State       &lt;- admin_groups_scaled$State\nscores$vote        &lt;- admin_groups_scaled$vote\nscores$admin_party &lt;- admin_groups_scaled$admin_party\nscores$color       &lt;- ifelse(scores$vote == \"Democrat\", \"blue\", \"red\")\n\n\nloadings &lt;- as.data.frame(pca_all$rotation[, 1:2])\nloadings$variable &lt;- rownames(loadings)\n\n\nscore_range &lt;- max(\n  range(scores$PC1), \n  range(scores$PC2)\n)\n\nloading_range &lt;- max(\n  sqrt(loadings$PC1^2 + loadings$PC2^2)\n)\n\narrow_scale &lt;- score_range / loading_range * 0.3  \n\nggplot(scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +\n\n  geom_point(aes(color = color), size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n\n  geom_text(aes(label = State, color = color),\n            size = 2.5,) +\n\n  geom_segment(data = loadings,\n               aes(x = 0, y = 0,\n                   xend = PC1 * arrow_scale,\n                   yend = PC2 * arrow_scale),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, \"cm\")),\n               color = \"black\") +\n\n  geom_text(data = loadings,\n            aes(x = PC1 * arrow_scale, \n                y = PC2 * arrow_scale, \n                label = variable),\n            color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  facet_wrap(~ admin_party) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"PCA of State-Level Economic Differences\",\n    x = \"PC1\",\n    y = \"PC2\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese biplots map the same PCA lines but adjust the location of the States to see specific trends across different political administrations. Under Republican administrations there are clearer clusters specifically for Republican States. States like Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming are very high on DPI and PI, while there is a cluster of red states lower. Additionally, very few Republican states are high on variables under Democratic administrations. Under Democratic administrations, Democratic states perform well, specifically for PCE.\nLooking at clusters, larger, more populated states, like California, New York, Massachusetts, are bigger outliers under Democratic administrations. Comparatively, under Republican administrates they tend to be closer with other states.\nAlso, the cluster of Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, related back to the findings on middle of the country states. They are higher on income related factors like PI and DPI under republican administrations which could indicate again those state’s benefit under Republican administration because of their geographical location.",
