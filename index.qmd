# Introduction

Political polarization in the United States as greatly intensified throughout the twenty-first century. In fact, partisan hatred, which is intense dislike for the opposite party, has increased considerably from the late 20th century to the mid 2010's, with negative sentiment targeted towards to opposite party's idealogies nearly doubling during that time within both major parties^[See Pew Research Center, "Political Polarization in the American Public," 2014.]. 

In the United States, the two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, dominate every presidential election cycle. In the 21st century (excluding the 2024 Presidential Election), there have been six elections, resulting in four different administrations: two Democratic and two Republican. Additionally, each party has "safe states," which predominantly vote for that party regardless of the election or candidate. This project will explore economic statistics for safe states at the state-by-state level from 2001 to 2024 (covering the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations). The goal of this project is to explore whether a state that consistently votes for the same party in every presidential election experiences stronger economic outcomes during that party's administrations than during the other party's administrations. Generally, this project aims to understand if political polarization is warranted, that is, are states truly better off always voting for the same party or are states more similar in economic turnout than political ideology.
