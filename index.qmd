# Introduction

Political polarization in the United States has intensified throughout the twenty-first century, with many states and demographics aligning with the same political parties every presidential election. In the United States, there are two major political parties, Democrats and Republicans, which dominate every presidential election cycle. While historically political parties have shown consistent geographic and demographic patterns, do these administrations truly improve the economic outcomes of the groups that vote for them? That is, do presidential administrations lead to better economic outcomes for constituencies that vote for them, or are outcomes broadly similar regardless of which party wins? For example, this project aims to answer a question like "Does a state that consistently votes for the Republican party every presidential election, experience stronger economic outcomes during Republican administrations compared to Democratic administrations?" This project will explore economic statistics at the state-by-state and demographic levels from 2001 to 2024 (covering the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations) to identify trends and differences across specific groups over time.
